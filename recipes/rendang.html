    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p><em>Image and recipe courtesy of Adam Liaw</em></p>
    <p>Just about every family in Singapore (and Malaysia and Indonesia)
        will have their own rendang recipe. Some rendangs will be dry and thick,
        others wet with gravy. Some will include powdered hard spices like cumin
        and coriander seeds, and barks such as cinnamon, and others won’t.
        Some will include kerisik (the caramelised coconut) to thicken the sauce,
        and others will leave it out.
    </p>
    <p>This recipe by Adam Liaw is dry-ish with just a small amount of thick gravy,
        very fragrant from turmeric, galangal and ginger instead of from hard spices,
        and toasty with kerisik.

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>¼ cup (60ml) vegetable oil or coconut oil</li>
        <li>2kg beef chuck steak, cut into 5–7cm pieces OR 3kg beef short ribs</li>
        <li>400ml tin coconut cream</li>
        <li>3 lemongrass stems, fat white stalks only, bruised</li>
        <li>3 kaffir lime leaves, plus extra shredded lime leaves to garnish</li>
        <li>1 piece of cassia bark</li>
        <li>2 star anise</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon caster sugar</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons salt</li>
        <li>1 cup (90g) desiccated coconut</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Rempah</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>2 medium-sized onions, or 8 eschalots</li>
        <li>5cm piece of fresh turmeric</li>
        <li>5cm piece of fresh galangal</li>
        <li>5cm piece of fresh ginger</li>
        <li>4 garlic cloves, peeled</li>
        <li>2–6 bird’s eye chillies (to taste), stalks removed</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>To make the rempah, peel and roughly chop the onions, turmeric, galangal
            and ginger and place in a blender. Add the peeled garlic cloves and
            chillies and blend to a purée, adding a little water to help it blend,
            if necessary.</li>
        <li>Heat the oil in a large, heavy-based flameproof casserole dish over
            medium heat and fry the rempah paste for 15–30 minutes, stirring
            occasionally at the beginning, and constantly as it thickens, so that it
            doesn’t splatter or catch on the base of the pan. The rempah is ready when
            it is browned, fragrant and thick.</li>
        <li>Add the beef and toss to coat in the rempah. Then add the coconut cream,
            and enough water to cover the meat. Add the lemongrass, whole lime leaves,
            cassia, star anise, sugar and salt. Bring to a simmer, then cover and simmer
            for about 2 hours, until the beef starts to become tender.</li>
        <li>Remove the lid and simmer for about 1 hour more, until the stewing liquid
            has reduced to a thick, oily sauce.</li>
        <li>Heat a dry frying pan over medium–low heat. Fry the coconut, stirring
            constantly, for about 5 minutes, or until it is a deep golden brown.
            This caramelised coconut is known as kerisik.</li>
        <li>Add the kerisik to the rendang, stirring to combine. Simmer for a further
            30 minutes or so, until the mixture is deep brown, oily and thick.</li>
        <li>The rendang can be eaten straight away but will benefit from being covered
            and left overnight to allow the flavours to develop.</li>
        <li>Serve scattered with finely shredded lime leaves.</li>
    </ol>
