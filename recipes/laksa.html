    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>We often think of laksa as just one dish, but travel through
        Singapore, Malaysia and Indonesia, and you'll find dozens of
        different varieties – like the sour, mackerel-based Penang laksa,
        the curry-thick Johor laksa made with dried spaghetti noodles,
        or even Singapore's home-grown Katong laksa, made with short-cut
        noodles and eaten as a soup with just a spoon, a little like a
        minestrone.</p>
    <p>The classic coconut milk laksa that we know and love goes by a few
        different names – Nyonya laksa, laksa lemak, curry laksa or even 
        curry mee – but the key to making it is always the same: rich fragrance
        from a long-cooked rempah, the slightly gritty texture of ground dried
        shrimp, a light creaminess from the coconut and a flavour punch from a
        spoon of sambal.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>2 tsp salt</li>
        <li>2 tsp sugar</li>
        <li>1 tsp fish sauce</li>
        <li>2 × 425ml tins coconut milk</li>
        <li>250g fried tofu puffs, halved</li>
        <li>4 boneless, skinless chicken thighs</li>
        <li>1 kg fresh Hokkien noodles</li>
        <li>200g dried rice vermicelli noodles</li>
        <li>200g fried fish cakes, sliced</li>
        <li>3⅓ cups (300g) bean sprouts</li>
        <li>8 eggs</li>
        <li>1 cup loosely packed Vietnamese mint leaves, finely shredded, to serve</li>
        <li>1 Lebanese cucumber, shredded, to serve</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Laksa Rempah</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>15 dried chillies, seeded and soaked in hot water for about 20 minutes</li>
        <li>4 large red chillies, seeded</li>
        <li>1 tbsp belacan (shrimp paste)</li>
        <li>6 shallots or 1 large brown onion, peeled and roughly chopped</li>
        <li>10 garlic cloves, peeled</li>
        <li>5cm piece of fresh ginger, peeled and thickly sliced</li>
        <li>5cm piece of fresh galangal, peeled and thickly sliced</li>
        <li>5cm piece of fresh turmeric, peeled and thickly sliced</li>
        <li>3 lemongrass stems, tender inner core only, roughly chopped</li>
        <li>2 tbsp ground coriander</li>
        <li>6 candlenuts (or macadamia nuts)</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Chilli Sambal</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>5 dried chillies, soaked</li>
        <li>3 large red chillies</li>
        <li>2 eschalots or ½ small onion, roughly chopped</li>
        <li>1 tsp belacan (shrimp paste)</li>
        <li>½ cup (125ml) peanut oil</li>
        <li>a pinch of sugar</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Start with the stock. Put the chicken bones in a large saucepan,
            cover with 10 cups (2.5 litres) water and bring to a low simmer.
            Gently simmer for about 2 hours, skimming off any scum that rises
            to the surface.</li>
        <li>Peel the prawns, leaving the tails on. Add two-thirds of the shells
            to the stock and simmer for a further 20 minutes. Stand for at least
            10 minutes, then strain, discarding the shells and bones (or reserve
            for making more stock); reserve the stock. De-vein and butterfly the
            prawns and refrigerate. Grind the dried shrimp to a wet, coarse powder
            in a small blender, or pound using a mortar and pestle. Set aside.</li>
        <li>Blend all the laksa rempah ingredients into a smooth paste.</li>
        <li>Heat a large saucepan over medium heat and add the oil. Fry the reserved
            prawn heads and shells until very fragrant, then remove the shells and heads,
            leaving the oil in the pan. Add half the laksa rempah (refrigerate the rest
            for another laksa) and fry for about 10 minutes, stirring frequently, until
            the oil separates from the paste. Add the reserved chicken stock and bring
            to a simmer.</li>
        <li>Stir in the dried shrimp and its soaking liquid, salt, sugar, fish sauce and
            coconut milk and simmer for about 20 minutes. Add the tofu puffs and chicken
            and simmer for a further 10 minutes. Remove the chicken, shred finely and set
            aside.</li>
        <li>Simmer the prawns in the soup for 3 minutes, or until just cooked, then remove
            and set aside. Taste the soup and adjust the seasoning as required.</li>
        <li>While the soup is cooking, prepare the remaining ingredients. Bring a large pot
            of water to the boil and cook the noodles according to the packet directions.
            While different brands will vary, generally hokkien noodles will just need to be
            blanched for a minute or so, while the vermicelli will need about 5 minutes. Boil
            the fish cake for about 2 minutes, or until puffed, then drain. Blanch the bean
            sprouts for 30 seconds. Boil the eggs for 7 minutes, then refresh in a basin of iced
            water and peel. Halve the eggs. Keep all the ingredients separate, so that you can
            build your laksa as you like it.</li>
        <li>For the chilli sambal, blend all the chillies together with the eschalot and belacan.
            Heat a small saucepan over medium heat and fry the paste in the peanut oil for about
            10 minutes, or until very fragrant, stirring frequently. Stir in the sugar and set
            aside for serving.</li>
        <li>To assemble each laksa, warm a noodle bowl (by pouring in a bit of the hot soup,
            then returning the soup to the pot). Add some hokkien noodles, vermicelli, bean
            sprouts, egg, fish cake, prawn and chicken to the bowl. Ladle in some soup, then
            garnish with Vietnamese mint, cucumber and a big spoonful of chilli sambal.
            Serve immediately.</li>
